    <p>There is another thing that deserves it's own special category.<br>
      <strong>Study, study, study...</strong><br>
      I do it <em>every-single-day</em> and I really enjoy doing it.<br>
      It really helps me to keep updated with tecnology and with my coding skills, all while learning a LOT!
